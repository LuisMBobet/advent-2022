# Advent of Code 2022

Advent of Code is a series of coding challenges set over over the month of December. You can see the challenges here - https://adventofcode.com/2022.

This year I'm learning Go and I figure this a good opportunity to practice it.

Each day will be it's own package with tests. The tests will test the example provided in the challenge and the final result of my particular challenge input.

Run the tests with `go run test`
